/*							catanf()
 *
 *	Complex circular arc tangent
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * float complex catanf();
 * float complex z, w;
 *
 * w = catanf( z );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * If
 *     z = x + iy,
 *
 * then
 *          1       (    2x     )
 * Re w  =  - arctan(-----------)  +  k PI
 *          2       (     2    2)
 *                  (1 - x  - y )
 *
 *               ( 2         2)
 *          1    (x  +  (y+1) )
 * Im w  =  - log(------------)
 *          4    ( 2         2)
 *               (x  +  (y-1) )
 *
 * Where k is an arbitrary integer.
 *
 *
 *
 * ACCURACY:
 *
 *                      Relative error:
 * arithmetic   domain     # trials      peak         rms
 *    IEEE      -10,+10     30000        2.3e-6      5.2e-8
