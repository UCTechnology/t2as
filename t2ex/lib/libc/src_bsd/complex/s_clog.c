/*							clog.c
 *
 *	Complex natural logarithm
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * double complex clog();
 * double complex z, w;
 *
 * w = clog (z);
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Returns complex logarithm to the base e (2.718...) of
 * the complex argument x.
 *
 * If z = x + iy, r = sqrt( x**2 + y**2 ),
 * then
 *       w = log(r) + i arctan(y/x).
 * 
 * The arctangent ranges from -PI to +PI.
 *
 *
 * ACCURACY:
 *
 *                      Relative error:
 * arithmetic   domain     # trials      peak         rms
 *    DEC       -10,+10      7000       8.5e-17     1.9e-17
 *    IEEE      -10,+10     30000       5.0e-15     1.1e-16
 *
 * Larger relative error can be observed for z near 1 +i0.
 * In IEEE arithmetic the peak absolute error is 5.2e-16, rms
 * absolute error 1.0e-16.
