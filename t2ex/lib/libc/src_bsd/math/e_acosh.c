/* acosh(x)
 * Method :
 *	Based on 
 *		acosh(x) = log [ x + sqrt(x*x-1) ]
 *	we have
 *		acosh(x) := log(x)+ln2,	if x is large; else
 *		acosh(x) := log(2x-1/(sqrt(x*x-1)+x)) if x>2; else
 *		acosh(x) := log1p(t+sqrt(2.0*t+t*t)); where t=x-1.
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	acosh(x) is NaN with signal if x<1.
 *	acosh(NaN) is NaN without signal.
